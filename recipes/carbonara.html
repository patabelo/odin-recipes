    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe for Spaghetti Carbonara Italian Style with bacon.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
        <li>12 slices thick-cut, applewood-smoked bacon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 large cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼ cup dry vermouth</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup whipping cream (Optional)</li>
        <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring
                occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until
                evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Reserve 2 tablespoons bacon fat in
                the skillet and discard the rest. Chop bacon when cool enough to handle.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and onion to reserved bacon fat in the skillet. Cook over medium-high heat
                until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until
                fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour vermouth into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits
                of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, about 1 minute. Mix in chopped bacon.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Drain spaghetti, transfer to a large serving bowl, and mix in remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add bacon-onion
                mixture, Parmesan cheese, cream, eggs, and pepper to the hot pasta; stir until spaghetti is well coated
                and sauce is creamy.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

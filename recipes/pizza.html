    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe for Pizza.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 Â½ cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Yeast
                Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes the pizza dough to
                rise.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Sugar
                To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon of sugar. The sugar
                gives the yeast something to eat and speeds up the activation process. You'll know your yeast is active
                when it becomes bubbly and frothy on top.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bread Flour
                Bread flour is ideal for pizza crust because it creates chewier results than all-purpose flour. This is
                because it contains more protein, which helps produce lots of gluten. Gluten is what gives the crust
                elasticity.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Olive Oil
                Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: Not only does it add color and flavor,
                but it creates a barrier between the oil and water. This oily barrier prevents sogginess.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Salt
                A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a chewier
                crust), and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise).</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
